# Privacy Policy
## Introduction

I understand the importance of your privacy, and I am committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines how I handle your information when you use the [App Name] app, which utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

By using this app, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described in this policy, please do not use the app.

Information Collection and Use
The Voice GPT app does not collect or store any personal data. All the processing is done on your device and no information is transmitted to or stored on any servers.

When you enter your GPT API key in the app, I store it locally on your device to enable the app's functionality. This key is not transmitted to or stored on any servers.

The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide its services. While using the app, your queries are sent to OpenAI's servers for processing, and the responses are returned to your device. Please refer to OpenAI's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle your data.

## Data Security
I take the security of your data very seriously. I implement industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety of the GPT API key stored locally on your device. However, please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective when I post the revised policy. Your continued use of the app following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
